# üåê VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) ‚Äì Interview Notes
### 1. What is a VPC?
**Answer:**
* VPC = **Virtual Private Cloud**.
* A logically isolated section of AWS cloud where you can launch resources (EC2, RDS, etc.) with your own networking configuration (subnets, route tables, etc.).
### 2. What is a **Subnet**?
**Answer:**
* A **range of IP addresses** inside a VPC.
* Used to organize and isolate resources.
* **Public Subnet** ‚Üí Has a route to **Internet Gateway** (resources accessible from internet).
* **Private Subnet** ‚Üí No direct internet access (used for DB, backend apps).
### 3. What is an **Availability Zone (AZ)**?
**Answer:**
* Isolated data center inside a **Region**.
* Subnets are created inside AZs.
* High availability = distribute resources across multiple AZs.
### 4. What is a **Security Group**?
**Answer:**
* A **virtual firewall** for instances.
* Controls **inbound & outbound traffic**.
* **Stateful** ‚Üí If inbound is allowed, response is automatically allowed.
### 5. What is an **Internet Gateway (IGW)**?
**Answer:**
* A gateway that allows **communication between VPC resources and the internet**.
* Must be attached to VPC to make public subnets accessible.
### 6. What is an **IP Address Range** in VPC?
**Answer:**
* Defined using **CIDR blocks** (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
* Divided into subnets (`10.0.1.0/24`, `10.0.2.0/24`, etc.).
### 7. What is a **Route Table**?
**Answer:**
* Defines **where traffic should go**.
* Example:
  * Public Subnet ‚Üí Route to IGW
  * Private Subnet ‚Üí Route to NAT Gateway
### 8. What is a **Load Balancer (ELB)?**
**Answer:**
* Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2, containers).
* Types: **ALB (Application)**, **NLB (Network)**, **CLB (Classic)**.
### 9. What is a **Target Group**?
**Answer:**
* A group of **EC2 instances or services** behind a Load Balancer.
* LB forwards traffic to target group based on health checks & rules.
### 10. **Flow of Traffic in VPC**
**Answer:**
Internet üåç ‚Üí **Internet Gateway (IGW)** ‚Üí **Public Subnet** (IP range check) ‚Üí **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** ‚Üí **Route Table** ‚Üí **Target Group** (EC2 instances) ‚Üí **NACL (Network ACL)** ‚Üí **NAT Gateway** (if private subnet needs internet)
### 11. What is a **NAT Gateway**?
**Answer:**
* Provides **internet access to instances in private subnet**.
* **Masks private IPs** with NAT‚Äôs public IP.
* Used for updates, downloads (but instances stay private).
### 12. What are **VPC Flow Logs**?
**Answer:**
* Logs that capture **IP traffic going in/out of network interfaces** in VPC.
* Helps in **monitoring, troubleshooting, and security analysis**.
* Stored in **CloudWatch** or **S3**.
