# 🌍 DNS & Route 53 – Interview Notes
### 1. What is **DNS**?
**Answer:**
* **Domain Name System** – translates **human-friendly domain names** (e.g., `example.com`) into **IP addresses** (e.g., `192.0.2.1`).
* Works like a **phonebook of the internet**.
### 2. What is **Amazon Route 53**?
**Answer:**
* A **scalable and highly available DNS web service** by AWS.
* Named "53" because **port 53** is used by DNS.
* Functions:
  1. Domain registration
  2. DNS routing
  3. Health checks & failover
### 3. **DNS Record Types** (commonly asked)
**Answer:**
* **A Record** → Maps domain to IPv4 address
* **AAAA Record** → Maps domain to IPv6 address
* **CNAME** → Maps one domain to another (alias)
* **MX** → Mail exchange server records
* **NS** → Nameservers of a domain
* **TXT** → Text info (SPF, DKIM, etc.)
* **Alias (AWS-specific)** → Like CNAME but can point to AWS resources (S3, ELB, CloudFront)
### 4. **Routing Policies in Route 53**
**Answer:**
1. **Simple Routing** → One record, one resource
2. **Weighted Routing** → Distribute traffic by percentage (e.g., 70% to one server, 30% to another)
3. **Latency-based Routing** → Directs users to region with lowest latency
4. **Failover Routing** → Active-passive setup (if one fails, switch to backup)
5. **Geolocation Routing** → Based on user’s geographic location
6. **Geoproximity Routing** → Based on proximity & optional traffic bias
7. **Multivalue Answer Routing** → Returns multiple healthy records
### 5. What are **Health Checks** in Route 53?
**Answer:**
* Route 53 can monitor the **health of endpoints** (e.g., EC2, load balancer).
* If unhealthy → automatically reroutes traffic to healthy resources.
### 6. How does traffic flow with Route 53?
**Answer:**
User enters domain → Query goes to **DNS resolver (ISP)** → Resolver checks **Route 53 nameservers** → Route 53 returns appropriate IP → Traffic sent to target (e.g., ELB, EC2).
### 7. Difference: **CNAME vs Alias in Route 53**
**Answer:**
* **CNAME** → Can only map to another domain, not AWS root domain.
* **Alias** → AWS extension, can point to AWS resources (e.g., ELB, S3, CloudFront) and can be used at **root domain** (`example.com`).
### 8. Why use Route 53 instead of normal DNS?
**Answer:**
* AWS-native (integrates with ELB, S3, CloudFront).
* Supports **Alias records** (not in standard DNS).
* Global infrastructure → **low latency & high availability**.
* Built-in **health checks & failover**.


# 📌 DNS Records – Interview Notes

| Record | Purpose               | Example                     |
| ------ | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| A      | Domain → IPv4         | `example.com → 192.0.2.1`   |
| AAAA   | Domain → IPv6         | `example.com → 2001:db8::1` |
| CNAME  | Domain → Domain       | `www → example.com`         |
| MX     | Email server          | `mail.example.com`          |
| NS     | Nameserver            | `ns1.route53.com`           |
| TXT    | Verification/Security | `SPF, DKIM`                 |
| PTR    | IP → Domain           | `192.0.2.1 → example.com`   |
| SRV    | Service host+port     | `_sip._tcp.example.com`     |
| SOA    | Domain authority info | Primary NS, contact         |
| Alias  | AWS-specific mapping  | Root → ELB/S3               |

DNS resolution starts with the browser/OS checking cache, then queries a recursive resolver → root server → TLD server → authoritative server → returns IP → browser connects to web server.
